<h1> My Single Web Page Application </h1>

<p>With This Repository I will be showcasing my skills and understanding of HTML and CSS as well as using some javascript and express.js to launch the server... I choose to start with a simple HTML Project because welll without this would we have ever need to become software developers??</p>

<p>On the main page you have 4 navigation buttons<br>Menu<br>Specials<br>Reservations<br>and Contacts</p>

<p>Each button will be linked to a corresponding page or simply direct you to a section of the page its on..<br>Below the nav section we will start off with 3 very yummy and tasty pictures</p>

<p>followed a div section about me container..the about me section will share a few quick insites about the situation and where we started this cheesy idea<br> Then below will have 3 addtional pictures <br>followed by the rest of the cheesy get down</p>

<p> keep in mind that this is just a basic html css application and i someday would like to make this dream reality so any insites and comments are welcomed... open to letting others add to it as well as long as they keeo it cheesy</p>
